NOTE: In order to run the project, you have to change the solution platform to x86

In this project I implemented:
- Using texture map for diffuse map and specular map
- Directional light
- Point light (with attenuation)
- Spot light

In this project I used
- "learnopengl.com" site for documentation. Some code lines on the site may be occur also in my project too.
